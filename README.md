# SAM-project
This project presents the design and implementation of a serverless application using AWS 
Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for user management. The application provides HTTP 
Api endpoint for user creation, retrieval, and data processing. The Serverless Framework is 
employed to define and deploy the AWS resources, including Lambda functions and 
DynamoDB table and Http Api. The project follows best practices for serverless architecture, 
emphasizing scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness.
